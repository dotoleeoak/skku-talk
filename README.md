## Getting Started

> Pre-requisites: Node.js(v18.17.0 or higher), pnpm(v8.x)

First, install pnpm with the following link: https://pnpm.io/installation  
If you already have pnpm installed, you can skip this step.

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
pnpm env use --global lts
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm run init
```

Finally, start the server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
